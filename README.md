# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**A computational model of the human left-ventricular epicardial myocyte.**   
Iyer V, Mazhari R, Winslow RL. _Biophys J_ 2004 Sep;87(3):1507-25

**Abstract:**   
A computational model of the human left-ventricular epicardial myocyte is
presented. Models of each of the major ionic currents present in these cells
are formulated and validated using experimental data obtained from studies of
recombinant human ion channels and/or whole-cell recording from single
myocytes isolated from human left-ventricular subepicardium. Continuous-time
Markov chain models for the gating of the fast Na(+) current, transient
outward current, rapid component of the delayed rectifier current, and the
L-type calcium current are modified to represent human data at physiological
temperature. A new model for the gating of the slow component of the delayed
rectifier current is formulated and validated against experimental data.
Properties of calcium handling and exchanger currents are altered to
appropriately represent the dynamics of intracellular ion concentrations. The
model is able to both reproduce and predict a wide range of behaviors observed
experimentally including action potential morphology, ionic currents,
intracellular calcium transients, frequency dependence of action-potential
duration, Ca(2+)-frequency relations, and extrasystolic restitution/post-
extrasystolic potentiation. The model therefore serves as a useful tool for
investigating mechanisms of arrhythmia and consequences of drug-channel
interactions in the human left-ventricular myocyte.
